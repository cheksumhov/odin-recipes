        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gumbo is a New Orleans stew that is thickened with roux, and commonly made with chicken, sausage, or seafood. It also includes vegetables like tomatoes and okra.</p>
        <p>Fundamental to a good gumbo is the "holy trinity", which consists of peppers, onions, and garlic.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup oil (vegetable or cancola)</li>
            <li>1 bunch celery, diced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh chopped parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>6-8 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>12 oz. package andouille sausage, sliced into coins</li>
            <li>meat from 1 rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>2 cups shrimp, pre-cooked</li>
            <li>hot cooked rice for serving</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the Roux: In a large, heavy bottom stock pot combine flour and oil. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring constantly for 30-45 minutes. This part takes patience--when it's finished it should be as dark as chocolate and have a soft, "cookie dough" like consistency. Be careful not to let it burn! Feel free to add a little more flour or oil as needed to reach this consistency.</li>
            <li>Brown the sausage. In a separate skillet on medium-high heat place the sausage slices in one layer in the pan. Brown them well on one side (2-3 minutes) and then use a fork to flip each over onto the other side to brown. Remove to a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook the vegetables in broth. Add ½ cup of the chicken broth to the hot skillet that had the sausage to deglaze the pan. Pour the broth and drippings into your large soup pot.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 5 ½ cups of chicken broth. Add veggies, parsley, garlic and roux to the pot and stir well.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil over medium heat and boil for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are slightly tender. (Skim off any foam that may rise to the top of the pot.) Stir in cajun seasoning, to taste.</li>
            <li>Add meat. Add chicken, sausage, and shrimp.</li>
            <li>Taste and serve. At this point taste it and add more seasonings to your liking--salt, pepper, chicken bullion paste, garlic, more Joe's stuff or more chicken broth--until you reach the perfect flavor. Serve warm over rice. (Tastes even better the next day!)</li>
        </ol>
